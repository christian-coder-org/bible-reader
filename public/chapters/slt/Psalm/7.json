    "1": "Song of David which he sang to Jehovah upon the words of Cush, son of the right hand. O Jehovah my God, in thee I put My trust: save me from all pursuing me, and deliver me:",
    "2": "Lest he shall rend my soul as the lion, breaking in pieces and none delivering.",
    "3": "O Jehovah my God, if I did this, if there is iniquity in my hand;",
    "4": "If I rewarded evil him being at peace with me; (and I will deliver mine enemy undeservedly:)",
    "5": "The enemy will pursue my soul, and overtake; and he will tread down my life to the earth, and he will cause mine honor to dwell upon the dust Silence.",
    "6": "Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger, lift up thyself for the wrath of mine enemies: and awake to me the judgment thou didst command.",
    "7": "And the assembly of the people shall surround thee: and for it turn back on high.",
    "8": "Jehovah shall judge peoples: judge me, O Jehovah, according to my justice, and according to mine integrity upon me.",
    "9": "Now shall the evil of the unjust come to an end; and thou wilt direct the just one: for the just God tried hearts and reins.",
    "10": "My shield upon God, saving the upright of heart.",
    "11": "God judging the just one, and being angry in all the days.",
    "12": "If he shall not turn back, he will sharpen his sword; he bent his bow and he will be prepared.",
    "13": "And he prepared to himself the instruments of death; he will work his arrows for those inflaming.",
    "14": "Behold, lie will bring forth vanity, and he conceived trouble, and he will bring forth falsehood.",
    "15": "He dug a pit, and he will dig it out, and he will fall into the pitfall he will make.",
    "16": "His trouble shall turn back upon his head, and his violence shall come down upon his crown.",
    "17": "I will confess to Jehovah according to his justice: and I will play on the harp to the name of Jehovah most high."
