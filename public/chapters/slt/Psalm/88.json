    "1": "A song of chanting to the sons of Korah to the overseer upon the lute, for affliction of instruction, for Heman the Ezrabite. O Jehovah, God of my salvation, the day have I cried in the night before thee.",
    "2": "My prayer shall come before thee: incline thine ear to my wailing;",
    "3": "For my soul was filled with evils, and my life touched upon hades.",
    "4": "I was reckoned with those going down to the pit: I was as a man of no strength:",
    "5": "Free among the dead, as they wounded lying down in the grave, whom thou no more didst remember them, and they were cut off by thy hand.",
    "6": "Thou didst set me in the pit beneath, in darknesses, in the shades.",
    "7": "Thy wrath lay upon me, and thou didst afflict with all thy breakers. Silence.",
    "8": "Thou didst remove far from me mine acquaintance; thou didst set me an abomination to them: I was shut up, and I shall not go forth.",
    "9": "Mine eye languished from affliction: I called to thee, O Jehovah, in all the day, I stretched my hands to thee.",
    "10": "Wilt thou do wonder to the dead? if the shades shall arise, shall they praise thee? Silence.",
    "11": "Shall thy mercy be recounted in the grave, thy faithfulness in destruction?",
    "12": "Shall thy wonder be known in darkness, and thy justice in a land of oblivion?",
    "13": "And to thee, O Jehovah, I cried, and in the morning shall my prayer anticipate thee.",
    "14": "Wherefore, O Jehovah, wilt thou cast off my soul? wilt thou hide thy face from me?",
    "15": "I am poor and expiring from youth: I bore thy terrors; I shall be perplexed.",
    "16": "Upon me thy burnings passed over; thy terrors made me silent.",
    "17": "They surrounded me as water all the day; they folded round about me together.",
    "18": "Thou didst remove far from me lover and friend, mine acquaintance into darkness."
