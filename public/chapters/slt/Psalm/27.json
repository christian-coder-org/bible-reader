    "1": "To David. Jehovah my light and my saviour; of whom shall I be afraid? Jehovah the strength of my life; from whom shall I tremble?",
    "2": "In the drawing near of those doing evil to me, to eat my flesh, adversaries and enemies to me, they were weak and fell.",
    "3": "If a camp shall encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: if war shall rise up against me, in this I trust.",
    "4": "I asked one from Jehovah, I will seek it; I sat in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to look upon the sweetness of Jehovah, and to inquire in his temple.",
    "5": "For he will hide me in the booth in the day of evil: he will cover me with the covering of his tent; he will lift me up upon a rock.",
    "6": "And now he will lift up my head over mine enemies round about me: and I will sacrifice in his tent sacrifices of rejoicing; I will sing and I will play on the harp to Jehovah.",
    "7": "Hear my voice, O Jehovah: I will call, and pity me and answer me.",
    "8": "My heart said to thee, Seek ye my face; thy face, O Jehovah, I will seek.",
    "9": "Thou wilt not cover thy face from me; thou wilt not turn away thy servant in anger: thou, wert my help; thou wilt not leave me and thou wilt not forsake me, my God saving me.",
    "10": "For my father and my mother forsook me, and Jehovah will gather me.",
    "11": "Teach me, O Jehovah, thy way, and lead me in a path of straitness for sake of those pressing me.",
    "12": "Thou wilt not give me to the soul of him pressing me, for witnesses of falsehood rose up against me, and violence will blow.",
    "13": "Unless I believed to look upon the goodness of Jehovah in the land of the living.",
    "14": "Wait for Jehovah: be strong, and thy heart shall be strengthened: and wait for Jehovah."
