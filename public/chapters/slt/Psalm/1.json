    "1": "Happy the man who went not in the counsel of the unjust, and he stood not in the way of the sinful, and sat not in the seat of those scoffing.",
    "2": "But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he will meditate day and night.",
    "3": "And he was as a tree planted by the streams of water which will give its fruit in its time; his leaf shall not fall away, and all which he shall do shall be prospered.",
    "4": "Not so the unjust: but as the chaff which the wind shall drive away.",
    "5": "For this, the unjust shall not rise up in judgment, and the sinful in the assembly of the just.",
    "6": "For Jehovah shall know the way of the just: but the way of the unjust shall perish."
