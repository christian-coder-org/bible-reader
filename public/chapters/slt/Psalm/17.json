    "1": "Prayer of David. Hear justice, O Jehovah, attend to my outcry, give ear to my prayer, not in lips of deceit.",
    "2": "From thy face shall my judgment go forth; thine eyes will see uprightnesses.",
    "3": "Thou didst try my heart; thou didst review the night; thou didst refine me, thou wilt find nothing: I purposed, my mouth shall not pass by.",
    "4": "For the works of men, by the word of thy lips I watched the ways of the violent one.",
    "5": "Hold up my being straight in thy ways, my steps be not moved.",
    "6": "I called thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: incline thine ear to me, hear my sayings.",
    "7": "Make thy kindnesses distinguished, thou saving those putting their trust, from those rising up against thy right hand.",
    "8": "Watch me as the pupil of the daughter of the eye: thou wilt hide me in the shadow of thy wings.",
    "9": "From the face of the unjust that laid me waste, enemies against the soul will go round about against me.",

    "15": "I in justice shall see thy face: I shall be satisfied in awaking with thine appearance."
