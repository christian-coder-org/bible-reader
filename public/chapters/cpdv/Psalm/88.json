    "1": "A Canticle Psalm to the sons of Korah. Unto the end. For Mahalath, to answer the understanding of Heman the Ezrahite. O Lord, God of my salvation: I have cried out, day and night, in your presence.",
    "2": "Let my prayer enter in your sight. Incline your ear to my petition.",
    "3": "For my soul has been filled with evils, and my life has drawn near to Hell.",
    "4": "I am considered to be among those who will descend into the pit. I have become like a man without assistance,",
    "5": "idle among the dead. I am like the wounded sleeping in sepulchers, whom you no longer remember, and who have been repelled by your hand.",
    "6": "They have lain me in the lower pit: in dark places and in the shadow of death.",
    "7": "Your fury has been confirmed over me. And you have brought all your waves upon me.",
    "8": "You have sent my acquaintances far from me. They have set me as an abomination to themselves. I was handed over, yet I did not depart.",
    "9": "My eyes languished before destitution. All day long, I cried out to you, O Lord. I stretched out my hands to you.",
    "10": "Will you perform wonders for the dead? Or will physicians raise to life, and so confess to you?",
    "11": "Could anyone declare your mercy in the sepulcher, or your truth from within perdition?",
    "12": "Will your wonders be known in the darkness, or your justice in the land of oblivion?",
    "13": "And I have cried out to you, O Lord, and in early morning, my prayer will come before you.",
    "14": "Lord, why do you reject my prayer? Why do you turn your face away from me?",
    "15": "I am poor, and I have been amid hardships from my youth. And, though I have been exalted, I am humbled and disturbed.",
    "16": "Your wrath has crossed into me, and your terrors have disturbed me.",
    "17": "They have surrounded me like water, all day long. They have surrounded me, all at once.",
    "18": "Friend and neighbor, and my acquaintances, you have sent far away from me, away from misery."
