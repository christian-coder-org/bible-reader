    "1": "A Psalm of David, when his son Absalom was pursuing him. O Lord, hear my prayer. Incline your ear to my supplication in your truth. Heed me according to your justice.",
    "2": "And do not enter into judgment with your servant. For all the living will not be justified in your sight.",
    "3": "For the enemy has pursued my soul. He has lowered my life to the earth. He has stationed me in darkness, like the dead of ages past.",
    "4": "And my spirit has been in anguish over me. My heart within me has been disturbed.",
    "5": "I have called to mind the days of antiquity. I have been meditating on all your works. I have meditated on the workings of your hands.",
    "6": "I have extended my hands to you. My soul is like a land without water before you.",
    "7": "O Lord, heed me quickly. My spirit has grown faint. Do not turn your face away from me, lest I become like those who descend into the pit.",
    "8": "Make me hear your mercy in the morning. For I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way that I should walk. For I have lifted up my soul to you.",
    "9": "O Lord, rescue me from my enemies. I have fled to you.",
    "10": "Teach me to do your will. For you are my God. Your good Spirit will lead me into the righteous land.",
    "11": "For the sake of your name, O Lord, you will revive me in your fairness. You will lead my soul out of tribulation.",
    "12": "And you will scatter my enemies in your mercy. And you will destroy all those who afflict my soul. For I am your servant."
