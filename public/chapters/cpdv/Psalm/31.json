    "1": "Unto the end. A Psalm of David according to an ecstasy. In you, Lord, I have hoped; let me never be confounded. In your justice, deliver me.",
    "2": "Incline your ear to me. Hasten to rescue me. Be for me a protector God and a house of refuge, so as to accomplish my salvation.",
    "3": "For you are my strength and my refuge; and for the sake of your name, you will lead me and nourish me.",
    "4": "You will lead me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me. For you are my protector.",
    "5": "Into your hands, I commend my spirit. You have redeemed me, O Lord, God of truth.",
    "6": "You have hated those who practice emptiness to no purpose. But I have hoped in the Lord.",
    "7": "I will exult and rejoice in your mercy. For you have looked upon my humility; you have saved my soul from needfulness.",
    "8": "And you have not enclosed me in the hands of the enemy. You have set my feet in a spacious place.",
    "9": "Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am troubled. My eye has been disturbed by wrath, along with my soul and my gut.",
    "10": "For my life has fallen into sorrow, and my years into sighing. My virtue has been weakened in poverty, and my bones have been disturbed.",
    "11": "I have become a disgrace among all my enemies, and even more so to my neighbors, and a dread to my acquaintances. Those who catch sight of me, flee away from me.",
    "12": "I have become forgotten, like one dead to the heart. I have become like a damaged utensil.",

    "19": "How great is the multitude of your sweetness, O Lord, which you keep hidden for those who fear you, which you have perfected for those who hope in you, in the sight of the sons of men.",
    "20": "You hide them in the concealment of your face, from the disturbance of men. You protect them in your tabernacle, from the contradiction of tongues.",
    "21": "Blessed is the Lord. For he has shown his wonderful mercy to me, in a fortified city.",
    "22": "But I said in the excess of my mind: “I have been cast away from the glance of your eyes.” And so, you heeded the voice of my prayer, while I was still crying out to you.",
    "23": "Love the Lord, all you his saints. For the Lord will require truth, and he will abundantly repay those who act with arrogance.",
    "24": "Act manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all you who hope in the Lord."
