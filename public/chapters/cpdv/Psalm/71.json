    "1": "A Psalm of David. Of the sons of Jonadab and the former captives. In you, O Lord, I have hoped; do not let me be brought to ruin forever.",
    "2": "Free me by your justice, and rescue me. Incline your ear to me, and save me.",
    "3": "Be a God of protection and a place of strength for me, so that you may accomplish my salvation. For you are my firmament and my refuge.",
    "4": "Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the sinner, and from the hand of the unjust and those who act against the law.",
    "5": "For you, O Lord, are my patience: my hope from my youth, O Lord.",
    "6": "In you, I have been confirmed from conception. From my mother’s womb, you are my protector. In you, I will sing forever.",
    "7": "I have become to many as if I were a portent, but you are a strong helper.",
    "8": "Let my mouth be filled with praise, so that I may sing your glory, your greatness all day long.",
    "9": "Do not cast me off in the time of old age. Do not abandon me when my strength will fail.",
    "10": "For my enemies have spoken against me. And those who watched for my soul have taken counsel as one,",
    "11": "saying: “God has abandoned him. Pursue and overtake him. For there is no one to rescue him.”",
    "12": "O God, do not be far from me. O my God, provide for my assistance.",
    "13": "May they be confounded, and may they fail, who drag down my soul. Let them be covered with confusion and shame, who seek evils for me.",
    "14": "But I will always have hope. And I will add more to all your praise.",
    "15": "My mouth will announce your justice, your salvation all day long. For I have not known letters.",
    "16": "I will enter into the powers of the Lord. I will be mindful of your justice alone, O Lord.",
    "17": "You have taught me from my youth, O God. And so I will declare your wonders continuously,",
    "18": "even in old age and with grey hairs. Do not abandon me, O God, while I announce your arm to every future generation: your power",
    "19": "and your justice, O God, even to the highest great things that you have done. O God, who is like you?",
    "20": "How great is the tribulation that you have revealed to me: very great and evil. And so, turning back, you have brought me to life, and you have led me back again from the abyss of the earth.",
    "21": "You have multiplied your magnificence. And so, turning back to me, you have consoled me.",
    "22": "Therefore, I will confess your truth to you, with the instruments of the Psalter. O God, I will sing psalms to you with stringed instruments, O Holy One of Israel.",
    "23": "My lips will exult, when I sing to you, and also my soul, which you have redeemed.",
    "24": "And even my tongue will meditate on your justice all day long, when those who seek evils for me have been confounded and set in awe."
