    "1": "A Psalm of Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to those who are upright in heart.",
    "2": "But my feet were nearly moved; my steps had nearly slipped.",
    "3": "For I was zealous over the iniquitous, seeing the peacefulness of sinners.",
    "4": "For they have no respect for their death, nor do they have support in their wounds.",
    "5": "They are not with the hardships of men, nor will they be scourged with men.",
    "6": "Therefore, arrogance has held on to them. They have been covered with their iniquity and impiety.",
    "7": "Their iniquity has proceeded, as if from fat. They have parted from the affection of the heart.",
    "8": "They have thought and spoken wickedness. They have spoken iniquity in high places.",
    "9": "They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has traversed the earth.",
    "10": "Therefore, my people will be converted here, and fullness of days will be found in them.",
    "11": "And they said, “How would God know?” and, “Isn’t there knowledge in high places?”",
    "12": "Behold, these are sinners, and, abounding in this age, they have obtained riches.",
    "13": "And I said: So then, it is without purpose that I have justified my heart and washed my hands among the innocent.",
    "14": "And I have been scourged all day long, and I have received my chastisement in the mornings.",
    "15": "If I were to say that I would explain this: Behold, I would condemn this nation of your sons.",
    "16": "I considered, so that I might know this. It is a hardship before me,",
    "17": "until I may enter into the Sanctuary of God, and understand it to its last part.",
    "18": "So, because of deceitfulness, truly, you have placed it before them. While they were being lifted up, you were casting them down.",
    "19": "How have they been brought to desolation? They have suddenly failed. They have perished because of their iniquity.",
    "20": "As a dream is to those who awaken, O Lord, so will you reduce their image to nothing in your city.",
    "21": "For my heart has been inflamed, and my temperament has been changed.",
    "22": "And so, I have been reduced to nothing, and I did not know it.",
    "23": "I have become like a beast of burden to you, and I am always with you.",
    "24": "You have held my right hand. And in your will, you have conducted me, and with your glory, you have taken me up.",
    "25": "For what is there for me in heaven? And what do I wish for on earth before you?",
    "26": "My body has failed, and my heart: O God of my heart, and God my portion, into eternity.",
    "27": "For behold, those who put themselves far from you will perish. You have perished all those who fornicate away from you.",
    "28": "But it is good for me to adhere to God, to put my hope in the Lord God, so that I may announce all your prophecies, at the gates of the daughter of Zion."
