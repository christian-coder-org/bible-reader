    "1": "A Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord because of the words of Cush, the son of Jemini. O Lord, my God, in you I have hoped. Save me from all those who persecute me, and free me:",
    "2": "lest at any time, like a lion, he might seize my soul, while there is no one to redeem me, nor any who can save.",
    "3": "O Lord, my God, if there is iniquity in my hands, if I have done this:",
    "4": "if I have repaid those who rendered evils to me, may I deservedly fall away empty before my enemies:",
    "5": "let the enemy pursue my soul, and take hold of it, and trample my life into the earth, and drag down my glory into the dust.",
    "6": "Rise up, Lord, in your anger. And be exalted to the borders of my enemies. And rise up, O Lord my God, according to the precept that you commanded,",
    "7": "and a congregation of people will surround you. And, because of this, return on high.",
    "8": "The Lord judges the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice and according to my innocence within me.",
    "9": "The wickedness of sinners will be consumed, and you will direct the just: the examiner of hearts and temperaments is God.",
    "10": "Just is my help from the Lord, who saves the upright of heart.",
    "11": "God is a just judge, strong and patient. How could he be angry throughout every day?",
    "12": "Unless you will be converted, he will brandish his sword. He has extended his bow and made it ready.",
    "13": "And with it, he has prepared instruments of death. He has produced his arrows for those on fire.",
    "14": "Behold him who has given birth to injustice: he has conceived sorrow and has begotten iniquity.",
    "15": "He has opened a pit and enlarged it. And he has fallen into the hole that he made.",
    "16": "His sorrow will be turned upon his own head, and his iniquity will descend upon his highest point.",
    "17": "I will confess to the Lord according to his justice, and I will sing a psalm to the name of the Lord Most High."
