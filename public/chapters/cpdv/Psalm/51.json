    "1": "Unto the end. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he went to Bathsheba. Be merciful to me, O God, according to your great mercy. And, according to the plentitude of your compassion, wipe out my iniquity.",
    "2": "Wash me once again from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.",
    "3": "For I know my iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.",
    "4": "Against you only have I sinned, and I have done evil before your eyes. And so, you are justified in your words, and you will prevail when you give judgment.",
    "5": "For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sinfulness did my mother conceive me.",
    "6": "For behold, you have loved truth. The obscure and hidden things of your wisdom, you have manifested to me.",
    "7": "You will sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be cleansed. You will wash me, and I will be made whiter than snow.",
    "8": "In my hearing, you will grant gladness and rejoicing. And the bones that have been humbled will exult.",
    "9": "Turn your face away from my sins, and erase all my iniquities.",
    "10": "Create a clean heart in me, O God. And renew an upright spirit within my inmost being.",
    "11": "Do not cast me away from your face; and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.",
    "12": "Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and confirm me with an unsurpassed spirit.",
    "13": "I will teach the unjust your ways, and the impious will be converted to you.",
    "14": "Free me from blood, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will extol your justice.",
    "15": "O Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will announce your praise.",
    "16": "For if you had desired sacrifice, I would certainly have given it, but with holocausts, you will not be delighted.",
    "17": "A crushed spirit is a sacrifice to God. A contrite and humbled heart, O God, you will not spurn.",
    "18": "Act kindly, Lord, in your good will toward Zion, so that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.",
    "19": "Then you will accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations, and holocausts. Then they will lay calves upon your altar."
