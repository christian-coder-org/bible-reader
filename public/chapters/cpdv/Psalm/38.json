    "1": "A Psalm of David, in commemoration of the Sabbath. O Lord, do not rebuke me in your fury, nor chastise me in your wrath.",
    "2": "For your arrows have been driven into me, and your hand has been confirmed over me.",
    "3": "There is no health in my flesh before the face of your wrath. There is no peace for my bones before the face of my sins.",
    "4": "For my iniquities have walked over my head, and they have been like a heavy burden weighing upon me.",
    "5": "My sores have putrefied and been corrupted before the face of my foolishness.",
    "6": "I have become miserable, and I have been bent down, even to the end. I have walked with contrition all day long.",
    "7": "For my loins have been filled with illusions, and there is no health in my flesh.",
    "8": "I have been afflicted and greatly humbled. I bellowed from the groaning of my heart.",
    "9": "O Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning before you has not been hidden.",
    "10": "My heart has been disturbed. My strength has abandoned me, and the light of my eyes has abandoned me, and it is not with me.",
    "11": "My friends and my neighbors have drawn near and stood against me. And those who were next to me stood far apart. And those who sought my soul used violence.",
    "12": "And those who sought evil accusations against me were speaking emptiness. And they practiced deceitfulness all day long.",
    "13": "But, like someone deaf, I did not hear. And I was like someone mute, not opening his mouth.",
    "14": "And I became like a man who does not hear, and who has no reproofs in his mouth.",
    "15": "For in you, Lord, I have hoped. You will listen to me, O Lord my God.",
    "16": "For I said, “Lest at any time, my enemies might rejoice over me,” and, “While my feet are being shaken, they have spoken great things against me.”",
    "17": "For I have been prepared for scourges, and my sorrow is ever before me.",
    "18": "For I will announce my iniquity, and I will think about my sin.",
    "19": "But my enemies live, and they have been stronger than me. And those who have wrongfully hated me have been multiplied.",
    "20": "Those who render evil for good have dragged me down, because I followed goodness.",
    "21": "Do not forsake me, O Lord my God. Do not depart from me.",
    "22": "Be attentive to my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation."
