    "1": "A Psalm of David. Judge me, O God, and discern my cause from that of a nation not holy; rescue me from a man unjust and deceitful.",
    "2": "For you are God, my strength. Why have you rejected me? And why do I walk in sadness, while the adversary afflicts me?",
    "3": "Send forth your light and your truth. They have guided me and led me, to your holy mountain and into your tabernacles.",
    "4": "And I will enter, up to the altar of God, to God who enlivens my youthfulness. To you, O God, my God, I will confess upon a stringed instrument.",
    "5": "Why are you sad, my soul? And why do you disquiet me? Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my countenance and my God."
