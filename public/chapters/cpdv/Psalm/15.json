    "1": "A Psalm of David. O Lord, who will dwell in your tabernacle? Or who will rest on your holy mountain?",
    "2": "He who walks without blemish and who works justice.",
    "3": "He who speaks the truth in his heart, who has not acted deceitfully with his tongue, and has not done evil to his neighbor, and has not taken up a reproach against his neighbors.",
    "4": "In his sight, the malicious one has been reduced to nothing, but he glorifies those who fear the Lord. He who swears to his neighbor and does not deceive.",
    "5": "He who has not given his money in usury, nor accepted bribes against the innocent. He who does these things will be undisturbed for eternity."
