    "1": "A Canticle Psalm. On the day of the Sabbath. It is good to confess to the Lord and to sing psalms to your name, O Most High:",
    "2": "to announce your mercy in the morning, and your truth throughout the night,",
    "3": "upon the ten strings, upon the psaltery, with a canticle, upon stringed instruments.",
    "4": "For you, O Lord, have delighted me with your doings, and I will exult in the works of your hands.",
    "5": "How great are your works, O Lord! Your thoughts have been made exceedingly deep.",
    "6": "A foolish man will not know these things, and a senseless one will not understand:",
    "7": "when sinners will have risen up like grass, and when all those who work iniquity will have appeared, that they shall pass away, age after age.",
    "8": "But you, O Lord, are the Most High for all eternity.",
    "9": "For behold your enemies, O Lord, for behold your enemies will perish, and all those who work iniquity will be dispersed.",
    "10": "And my horn will be exalted like that of the single-horned beast, and my old age will be exalted in fruitful mercy.",
    "11": "And my eye has looked down upon my enemies, and my ear will hear of the malignant rising up against me.",
    "12": "The just one will flourish like the palm tree. He will be multiplied like the cedar of Lebanon.",
    "13": "Those planted in the house of the Lord will flourish in the courts of the house of our God.",
    "14": "They will still be multiplied in a fruitful old age, and they will endure well,",
    "15": "so that they may announce that the Lord our God is righteous and that there is no iniquity in him."
