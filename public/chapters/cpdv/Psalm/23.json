    "1": "A Psalm of David. The Lord directs me, and nothing will be lacking to me.",
    "2": "He has settled me here, in a place of pasture. He has led me out to the water of refreshment.",
    "3": "He has converted my soul. He has led me away on the paths of justice, for the sake of his name.",
    "4": "For, even if I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils. For you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they have given me consolation.",
    "5": "You have prepared a table in my sight, opposite those who trouble me. You have anointed my head with oil, and my cup, which inebriates me, how brilliant it is!",
    "6": "And your mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and so may I dwell in the house of the Lord for length of days."
