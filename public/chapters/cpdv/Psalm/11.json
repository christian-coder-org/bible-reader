    "1": "Unto the end. A Psalm of David. I trust in the Lord. How can you say to my soul, “Sojourn to the mountain, like a sparrow.”",
    "2": "For behold, the sinners have bent their bow. They have prepared their arrows in the quiver, so as to shoot arrows in the dark at the upright of heart.",
    "3": "For they have destroyed the things that you have completed. But what has the just one done?",
    "4": "The Lord is in his holy temple. The Lord’s throne is in heaven. His eyes look upon the poor. His eyelids question the sons of men.",
    "5": "The Lord questions the just and the impious. Yet he who loves iniquity, hates his own soul.",
    "6": "He will rain down snares upon sinners. Fire and brimstone and windstorms will be the portion of their cup.",
    "7": "For the Lord is just, and he has chosen justice. His countenance has beheld equity."
