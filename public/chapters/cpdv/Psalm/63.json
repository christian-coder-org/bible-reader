    "1": "A Psalm of David, when he was in the desert of Idumea. O God, my God: to you, I keep vigil until first light. For you, my soul has thirsted, to you my body, in so many ways.",
    "2": "By a deserted land, both inaccessible and waterless, so I have appeared in the sanctuary before you, in order to behold your virtue and your glory.",
    "3": "For your mercy is better than life itself. It is you my lips will praise.",
    "4": "So will I bless you in my life, and I will lift up my hands in your name.",
    "5": "Let my soul be filled, as if with marrow and fatness; and my mouth will give praise with exultant lips.",
    "6": "When I have remembered you on my bed in the morning, I will meditate on you.",
    "7": "For you have been my helper. And I will exult under the cover of your wings.",
    "8": "My soul has clung close to you. Your right hand has supported me.",
    "9": "Truly, these ones have sought my soul in vain. They will enter into the lower parts of the earth.",
    "10": "They will be delivered into the hand of the sword. They will be the portions of foxes.",
    "11": "Truly, the king will rejoice in God: all those who swear by him will be praised, because the mouth of those who speak iniquity has been blocked."
