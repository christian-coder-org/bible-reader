    "1": "Unto the end. May you not destroy. Of David, with the inscription of a title, when he fled from Saul into a cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me. For my soul trusts in you. And I will hope in the shadow of your wings, until iniquity passes away.",
    "2": "I will cry out to God Most High, to God who has been kind to me.",
    "3": "He sent from heaven and freed me. He has surrendered into disgrace those who trampled me. God has sent his mercy and his truth.",
    "4": "And he has rescued my soul from the midst of the young lions. I slept troubled. The sons of men: their teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue is a sharp sword.",
    "5": "Be exalted above the heavens, O God, and your glory above all the earth.",
    "6": "They prepared a snare for my feet, and they bowed down my soul. They dug a pit before my face, yet they have fallen into it.",
    "7": "My heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared. I will sing, and I will compose a psalm.",
    "8": "Rise up, my glory. Rise up, psaltery and harp. I will arise in early morning.",
    "9": "I will confess to you, O Lord, among the peoples. I will compose a psalm to you among the nations.",
    "10": "For your mercy has been magnified, even to the heavens, and your truth, even to the clouds.",
    "11": "Be exalted above the heavens, O God, and your glory above all the earth."
