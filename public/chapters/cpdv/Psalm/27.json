    "1": "A Psalm of David, before he was sealed. The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?",
    "2": "Meanwhile, the guilty draw near to me, so as to eat my flesh. Those who trouble me, my enemies, have themselves been weakened and have fallen.",
    "3": "If entrenched armies were to stand together against me, my heart would not fear. If a battle were to rise up against me, I would have hope in this.",
    "4": "One thing I have asked of the Lord, this I will seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, so that I may behold the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.",
    "5": "For he has hidden me in his tabernacle. In the day of evils, he has protected me in the hidden place of his tabernacle.",
    "6": "He has exalted me upon the rock, and now he has exalted my head above my enemies. I have circled around and offered a sacrifice of loud exclamation in his tabernacle. I will sing, and I will compose a psalm, to the Lord.",
    "7": "Hear my voice, O Lord, with which I have cried out to you. Have mercy on me, and hear me.",
    "8": "My heart has spoken to you; my face has sought you. I yearn for your face, O Lord.",
    "9": "Do not turn your face away from me. In your wrath, do not turn aside from your servant. Be my helper. Do not abandon me, and do not despise me, O God, my Saviour.",
    "10": "For my father and my mother have left me behind, but the Lord has taken me up.",
    "11": "O Lord, establish a law for me in your way, and direct me in the right path, because of my enemies.",
    "12": "Do not surrender me to the souls of those who trouble me. For unjust witnesses have risen up against me, and iniquity has lied to itself.",
    "13": "I believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.",
    "14": "Wait for the Lord, act manfully; and let your heart be strengthened, and remain with the Lord."
