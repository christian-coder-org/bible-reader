    "1": "Unto the end. A Psalm of David. O Lord, you have examined me, and you have known me.",
    "2": "You have known my sitting down and my rising up again.",
    "3": "You have understood my thoughts from afar. My path and my fate, you have investigated.",
    "4": "And you have foreseen all my ways. For there is no word in my tongue.",
    "5": "Behold, O Lord, you have known all things: the newest and the very old. You have formed me, and you have placed your hand over me.",
    "6": "Your knowledge has become a wonder to me. It has been reinforced, and I am not able to prevail against it.",
    "7": "Where will I go from your Spirit? And where will I flee from your face?",
    "8": "If I ascend into heaven, you are there. If I descend into Hell, you are near.",
    "9": "If I assume my feathers in early morning, and dwell in the utmost parts of the sea,",
    "10": "even there, your hand will lead me forth, and your right hand will hold me.",
    "11": "And I said: Perhaps darkness will overwhelm me, and the night will be my illumination, to my delight.",
    "12": "But darkness will not be impenetrable to you, and night will illuminate like the day: for just as its darkness is, so also is its light.",
    "13": "For you have possessed my temperament. You have supported me from the womb of my mother.",
    "14": "I will confess to you, for you have been magnified terribly. Your works are miraculous, as my soul knows exceedingly well.",
    "15": "My bone, which you have made in secret, has not been hidden from you, and my substance is in accord with the lower parts of the earth.",
    "16": "Your eyes saw my imperfection, and all this shall be written in your book. Days will be formed, and no one shall be in them.",
    "17": "But to me, O God, your friends have been greatly honored. Their first ruler has been exceedingly strengthened.",
    "18": "I will number them, and they will be more numerous than the sand. I rose up, and I am still with you.",
    "19": "O God, if only you would cut down sinners. You men of blood: depart from me.",
    "20": "For you say in thought: They will accept your cities in vain.",
    "21": "Have I not hated those who hated you, Lord, and wasted away because of your enemies?",
    "22": "I have hated them with a perfect hatred, and they have become enemies to me.",
    "23": "Examine me, O God, and know my heart. Question me, and know my paths.",
    "24": "And see if there might be in me the way of iniquity, and lead me in the way of eternity."
