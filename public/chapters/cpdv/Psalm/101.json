    "1": "A Psalm of David himself. I will sing mercy and judgment to you, O Lord. I will sing psalms.",
    "2": "And I will have understanding within the immaculate way, when you will draw near to me. I wandered about in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.",
    "3": "I will not display any unjust thing before my eyes. I have hated those carrying out betrayals.",
    "4": "The perverse heart did not adhere to me. And the malignant, who turned away before me, I would not recognize.",
    "5": "The one who secretly detracted his neighbor, this one I pursued. The one with an arrogant eye and an insatiable heart, with that one I would not eat.",
    "6": "My eyes looked toward the faithful of the earth, to sit with me. The one walking in the immaculate way, this one ministered to me.",
    "7": "He who has acted arrogantly will not dwell in the midst of my house. He who has spoken iniquity was not guided with the sight of my eyes.",
    "8": "In the morning, I executed all the sinners of the earth, so that I might scatter all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord."
