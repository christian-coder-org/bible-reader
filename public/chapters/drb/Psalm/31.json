    "1": "Unto the end, a psalm for David, in an ecstasy. In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, Iet me never be confounded: deliver me in thy justice.",
    "2": "Bow down thy ear to me: make haste to deliver me. Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, to save me.",
    "3": "For thou art my strength and my refuge; and for thy nameâ€™s sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.",
    "4": "Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: for thou art my protector.",
    "5": "Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth.",
    "6": "Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, to no purpose. But I have hoped in the Lord:",
    "7": "I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy. For thou best regarded my humility, thou hast saved my soul out of distresses.",
    "8": "And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a spacious place.",
    "9": "Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled with wrath, my soul, and my belly:",
    "10": "For my life is wasted with grief: and my years in sighs. My strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed.",
    "11": "I am become a reproach among all my enemies, and very much to my neighbours; and a fear to my acquaintance. They that saw me without fled from me.",
    "12": "I am forgotten as one dead from the heart. I am become as a vessel that is destroyed.",
    "13": "For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about. While they assembled together against me, they consulted to take away my life.",
    "14": "But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my God.",
    "15": "My lots are in thy hands. Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies; and from them that persecute me.",
    "16": "Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy.",
    "17": "Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee. Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell.",
    "18": "Let deceitful lips be made dumb. Which speak iniquity against the just, with pride and abuse.",
    "19": "O how great is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord, which thou hast hidden for them that fear thee! Which thou hast wrought for them that hope in thee, in the sight of the sons of men.",
    "20": "Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, from the disturbance of men. Thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues.",
    "21": "Blessed be the Lord, for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me in a fortified city.",
    "22": "But I said in the excess of my mind: I am cast away from before thy eyes. Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, when I cried to thee.",
    "23": "O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord will require truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly.",
    "24": "Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord."
