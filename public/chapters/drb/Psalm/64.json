    "1": "Unto the end, a psalm for David. Hear, O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee : deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.",
    "2": "Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.",
    "3": "For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; they have bent their bow a bitter thing,",
    "4": "to shoot in secret the undefiled.",
    "5": "They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: they are resolute in wickedness. They have talked of hiding snares; they have said: Who shall see them?",
    "6": "They have searched after iniquities: they have failed in their search. Man shall come to a deep heart:",
    "7": "and God shall be exalted. The arrows of children are their wounds:",
    "8": "and their tongues against them are made weak. All that saw them were troubled;",
    "9": "and every man was afraid. And they declared the works of God: and understood his doings.",
    "10": "The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: and all the upright in heart shall be praised."
