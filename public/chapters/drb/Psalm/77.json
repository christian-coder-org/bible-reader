    "1": "Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph. I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.",
    "2": "In the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted:",
    "3": "I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.",
    "4": "My eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not.",
    "5": "I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal years.",
    "6": "And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.",
    "7": "Will God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more favourable again?",
    "8": "Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation?",
    "9": "Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?",

    "17": "Great was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a sound. For thy arrows pass:",
    "18": "the voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings enlightened the world: the earth shook and trembled.",
    "19": "Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy footsteps shall not be known.",
