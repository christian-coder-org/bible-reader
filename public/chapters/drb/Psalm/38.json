    "1": "A psalm for David, for a remembrance of the sabbath. Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; nor chastise me in thy wrath.",
    "2": "For thy arrows are fastened in me : and thy hand hath been strong upon me.",
    "3": "There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath : there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins.",
    "4": "For my iniquities are gone over my head : and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me.",
    "5": "My sores are putrified and corrupted, because of my foolishness.",
    "6": "I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end : I walked sorrowful all the day long.",
    "7": "For my loins are filled with illusions; and there is no health in my flesh.",
    "8": "I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly : I roared with the groaning of my heart.",
    "9": "Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hidden from thee.",
    "10": "My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the light of my eyes itself is not with me.",
    "11": "My friends and my neighbours have drawn near, and stood against me. And they that were near me stood afar off :",
    "12": "And they that sought my soul used violence. And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long.",
    "13": "But I, as a deaf man, heard not : and as a dumb man not opening his mouth.",
    "14": "And I became as a man that heareth not : and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.",
    "15": "For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped : thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.",
    "16": "For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me : and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.",
    "17": "For I am ready for scourges : and my sorrow is continually before me.",
    "18": "For I will declare my inequity : and I will think for my sin.",
    "19": "But my enemies live, and are stronger that I : and they hate me wrongfully are multiplied.",
    "20": "They that render evil for good, have detracted me, because I followed goodness.",
    "21": "Forsake me not, O Lord my God : do not thou depart from me.",
    "22": "Attend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation."
