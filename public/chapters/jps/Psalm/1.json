    "1": "HAPPY IS the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stood in the way of sinners, Nor sat in the seat of the scornful.",
    "2": "But his delight is in the law of the LORD; And in His law doth he meditate day and night.",
    "3": "And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, And whose leaf doth not wither; And in whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper.",
    "4": "Not so the wicked; But they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.",
    "5": "Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.",
    "6": "For the LORD regardeth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish."
