    "1": "For the Leader; upon Shoshannim; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves.   My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter; I say: ‘My work is concerning a king’; My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.",
    "2": "Thou art fairer than the children of men; Grace is poured upon thy lips; Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.",
    "3": "Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, Thy glory and thy majesty.",
    "4": "And in thy majesty prosper, ride on, In behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness; And let thy right hand teach thee tremendous things.",
    "5": "Thine arrows are sharp—The peoples fall under thee—[They sink] into the heart of the king’s enemies.",
    "6": "Thy throne given of God is for ever and ever; A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.",
    "7": "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.",
    "8": "Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia are all thy garments; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.",
    "9": "Kings’ daughters are among thy favourites; At thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.",
    "10": "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; Forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house;",
    "11": "So shall the king desire thy beauty; For he is thy lord; and do homage unto him.",
    "12": "And, O daughter of Tyre, the richest of the people Shall entreat thy favour with a gift.’",
    "13": "All glorious is the king’s daughter within the palace; Her raiment is of chequer work inwrought with gold.",
    "14": "She shall be led unto the king on richly woven stuff; The virgins her companions in her train being brought unto thee.",
    "15": "They shall be led with gladness and rejoicing; They shall enter into the king’s palace.",
    "16": "Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons, Whom thou shalt make princes in all the land.",
    "17": "I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations; Therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever and ever."
