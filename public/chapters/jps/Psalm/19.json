    "1": "For the Leader. A Psalm of David.   The heavens declare the glory of God, And the firmament showeth His handiwork;",
    "2": "Day unto day uttereth speech, And night unto night revealeth knowledge;",
    "3": "There is no speech, there are no words, Neither is their voice heard.",
    "4": "Their line is gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them hath He set a tent for the sun,",
    "5": "Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.",
    "6": "His going forth is from the end of the heaven, And his circuit unto the ends of it; And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.",
    "7": "The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.",
    "8": "The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.",
    "9": "The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever; The ordinances of the LORD are true, they are righteous altogether;",
    "10": "More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.",
    "11": "Moreover by them is Thy servant warned; In keeping of them there is great reward.",
    "12": "Who can discern his errors? Clear Thou me from hidden faults.",
    "13": "Keep back Thy servant also from presumptuous sins, That they may not have dominion over me; then shall I be faultless, And I shall be clear from great transgression.",
    "14": "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, O LORD, my Rock, and my Redeemer."
