    "1": "A Psalm, a Song. For the sabbath day.   It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, And to sing praises unto Thy name, O Most High;",
    "2": "To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning, And Thy faithfulness in the night seasons,",
    "3": "With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; With a solemn sound upon the harp.",
    "4": "For Thou, LORD, hast made me glad through Thy work; I will exult in the works of Thy hands.",
    "5": "How great are Thy works, O LORD! Thy thoughts are very deep.",
    "6": "A brutish man knoweth not, Neither doth a fool understand this.",
    "7": "When the wicked spring up as the grass, And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; It is that they may be destroyed for ever.",
    "8": "But Thou, O LORD, art on high for evermore.",
    "9": "For, lo, Thine enemies, O LORD, For, lo, Thine enemies shall perish: All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.",
    "10": "But my horn hast Thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox; I am anointed with rich oil.",
    "11": "Mine eye also hath gazed on them that lie in wait for me, Mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.",
    "12": "The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.",
    "13": "Planted in the house of the LORD, They shall flourish in the courts of our God.",
    "14": "They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and richness;",
    "15": "To declare that the LORD is upright, My Rock, in whom there is no unrighteousness."
