    "1": "[A Psalm] of Solomon.  Give the king Thy judgments, O God, And Thy righteousness unto the kingâ€™s son;",
    "2": "That he may judge Thy people with righteousness, And Thy poor with justice.",
    "3": "Let the mountains bear peace to the people, And the hills, through righteousness.",
    "4": "May he judge the poor of the people, And save the children of the needy, And crush the oppressor.",
    "5": "They shall fear Thee while the sun endureth, And so long as the moon, throughout all generations.",
    "6": "May he come down like rain upon the mown grass, As showers that water the earth.",
    "7": "In his days let the righteous flourish, And abundance of peace, till the moon be no more.",
    "8": "May he have dominion also from sea to sea, And from the River unto the ends of the earth.",
    "9": "Let them that dwell in the wilderness bow before him; And his enemies lick the dust.",
    "10": "The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute; The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.",
    "11": "Yea, all kings shall prostrate themselves before him; All nations shall serve him.",

    "14": "He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence, And precious will their blood be in his sight.",
    "15": "That they may live, and that he may give them of the gold of Sheba, That they may pray for him continually, Yea, bless him all the day.",
    "16": "May he be as a rich cornfield in the land upon the top of the mountains; May his fruit rustle like Lebanon; And may they blossom out of the city like grass of the earth.",
    "17": "May his name endure for ever; May his name be continued as long as the sun; May men also bless themselves by him; May all nations call him happy.",
    "18": "Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, Who only doeth wondrous things;",
    "19": "And blessed be His glorious name for ever; And let the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen.",
