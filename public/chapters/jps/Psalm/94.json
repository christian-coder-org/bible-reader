    "1": "O LORD, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.",
    "2": "Lift up Thyself, Thou Judge of the earth; Render to the proud their recompense.",
    "3": "LORD, how long shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked exult?",
    "4": "They gush out, they speak arrogancy; All the workers of iniquity bear themselves loftily.",
    "5": "They crush Thy people, O LORD, And afflict Thy heritage.",
    "6": "They slay the widow and the stranger, And murder the fatherless.",
    "7": "And they say: ‘The LORD will not see, Neither will the God of Jacob give heed.’",
    "8": "Consider, ye brutish among the people; And ye fools, when will ye understand?",
