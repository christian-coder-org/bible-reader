    "2": "How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart by day? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?",
    "3": "Behold Thou, and answer me, O LORD my God; Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;",
    "4": "Lest mine enemy say: ‘I have prevailed against him’; Lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.",
    "5": "But as for me, in Thy mercy do I trust; My heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation.",
    "6": "I will sing unto the LORD, Because He hath dealt bountifully with me."
