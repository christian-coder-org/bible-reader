    "1": "For the Leader; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil.   O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us; A work Thou didst in their days, in the days of old.",
    "2": "Thou with Thy hand didst drive out the nations, and didst plant them in; Thou didst break the peoples, and didst spread them abroad.",
    "3": "For not by their own sword did they get the land in possession, Neither did their own arm save them; But Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance, Because Thou wast favourable unto them.",
    "4": "Thou art my King, O God; Command the salvation of Jacob.",
    "5": "Through Thee do we push down our adversaries; Through Thy name do we tread them under that rise up against us.",
    "6": "For I trust not in my bow, Neither can my sword save me.",
    "7": "But Thou hast saved us from our adversaries, And hast put them to shame that hate us.",
    "8": "In God have we gloried all the day, And we will give thanks unto Thy name for ever.  Selah ",
    "9": "Yet Thou hast cast off, and brought us to confusion; And goest not forth with our hosts.",
    "10": "Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; And they that hate us spoil at their will.",
    "11": "Thou hast given us like sheep to be eaten; And hast scattered us among the nations.",
    "12": "Thou sellest Thy people for small gain, And hast not set their prices high.",
    "13": "Thou makest us a taunt to our neighbours, A scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.",
    "14": "Thou makest us a byword among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.",
    "15": "All the day is my confusion before me, And the shame of my face hath covered me,",
    "16": "For the voice of him that taunteth and blasphemeth; By reason of the enemy and the revengeful.",
    "17": "All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten Thee, Neither have we been false to Thy covenant.",
    "18": "Our heart is not turned back, Neither have our steps declined from Thy path;",
    "19": "Though Thou hast crushed us into a place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.",
    "20": "If we had forgotten the name of our God, Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;",
    "21": "Would not God search this out? For He knoweth the secrets of the heart.",
    "22": "Nay, but for Thy sake are we killed all the day; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.",
    "23": "Awake, why sleepest Thou, O Lord? Arouse Thyself, cast not off for ever.",
    "24": "Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, And forgettest our affliction and our oppression?",
    "25": "For our soul is bowed down to the dust; Our belly cleaveth unto the earth.",
    "26": "Arise for our help, And redeem us for Thy mercyâ€™s sake."
