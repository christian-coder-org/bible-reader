    "1": "Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, Thou art very great; Thou art clothed with glory and majesty.",
    "2": "Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;",
    "3": "Who layest the beams of Thine upper chambers in the waters, Who makest the clouds Thy chariot, Who walkest upon the wings of the wind;",
    "4": "Who makest winds Thy messengers, The flaming fire Thy ministers.",
    "5": "Who didst establish the earth upon its foundations, That it should not be moved for ever and ever;",
    "6": "Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains.",
    "7": "At Thy rebuke they fled, At the voice of Thy thunder they hasted away—",
    "8": "The mountains rose, the valleys sank down—Unto the place which Thou hadst founded for them;",
    "9": "Thou didst set a bound which they should not pass over, That they might not return to cover the earth.",
    "10": "Who sendest forth springs into the valleys; They run between the mountains;",
    "11": "They give drink to every beast of the field, The wild asses quench their thirst.",
    "12": "Beside them dwell the fowl of the heaven, From among the branches they sing.",
    "13": "Who waterest the mountains from Thine upper chambers; The earth is full of the fruit of Thy works.",
    "14": "Who causeth the grass to spring up for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; To bring forth bread out of the earth,",
    "15": "And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, Making the face brighter than oil, And bread that stayeth man’s heart.",
    "16": "The trees of the LORD have their fill, The cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted;",
    "17": "Wherein the birds make their nests; As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.",
    "18": "The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies.",
    "19": "Who appointedst the moon for seasons; The sun knoweth his going down.",
    "20": "Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.",
    "21": "The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God.",
    "22": "The sun ariseth, they slink away, And couch in their dens.",
    "23": "Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labour until the evening.",
    "24": "How manifold are Thy works, O LORD! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; The earth is full of Thy creatures.",
    "25": "Yonder sea, great and wide, Therein are creeping things innumerable, Living creatures, both small and great.",
    "26": "There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to sport therein.",
    "27": "All of them wait for Thee, That Thou mayest give them their food in due season.",
    "28": "Thou givest it unto them, they gather it; Thou openest Thy hand, they are satisfied with good.",
    "29": "Thou hidest Thy face, they vanish; Thou withdrawest their breath, they perish, And return to their dust.",
    "30": "Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created; And Thou renewest the face of the earth.",
    "31": "May the glory of the LORD endure for ever; Let the LORD rejoice in His works!",
    "32": "Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.",
    "33": "I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.",
    "34": "Let my musing be sweet unto Him; As for me, I will rejoice in the LORD.",
    "35": "Let sinners cease out of the earth, And let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul.  Hallelujah."
