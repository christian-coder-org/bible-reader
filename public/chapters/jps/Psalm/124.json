    "1": "A Song of Ascents; of David.  ‘If it had not been the LORD who was for us’, Let Israel now say;",
    "2": "If it had not been the LORD who was for us, When men rose up against us,",
    "3": "Then they had swallowed us up alive, When their wrath was kindled against us;",
    "4": "Then the waters had overwhelmed us, The stream had gone over our soul;",
    "5": "Then the proud waters Had gone over our soul.’",
    "6": "Blessed be the LORD, Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.",
    "7": "Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; The snare is broken, and we are escaped.",
    "8": "Our help is in the name of the LORD, Who made heaven and earth."
