    "1": "For the Leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.   Hear this, all ye peoples; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,",
    "2": "Both low and high, Rich and poor together.",
    "3": "My mouth shall speak wisdom, And the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.",
    "4": "I will incline mine ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying upon the harp.",
    "5": "Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, When the iniquity of my supplanters compasseth me about,",
    "6": "Of them that trust in their wealth, And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches?",
    "7": "No man can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him—",
    "8": "For too costly is the redemption of their soul, And must be let alone for ever—",
    "9": "That he should still live alway, That he should not see the pit.",
    "10": "For he seeth that wise men die, The fool and the brutish together perish, And leave their wealth to others.",
    "11": "Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, And their dwelling-places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names.",
    "12": "But man abideth not in honour; He is like the beasts that perish.",
    "13": "This is the way of them that are foolish, And of those who after them approve their sayings.  Selah ",
    "14": "Like sheep they are appointed for the nether-world; Death shall be their shepherd; And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their form shall be for the nether-world to wear away, That there be no habitation for it.",
    "15": "But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether-world; For He shall receive me.  Selah ",
    "16": "Be not thou afraid when one waxeth rich, When the wealth of his house is increased;",
    "17": "For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; His wealth shall not descend after him.",
    "18": "Though while he lived he blessed his soul: ‘Men will praise thee, when thou shalt do well to thyself’;",
    "19": "It shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see the light.",
    "20": "Man that is in honour understandeth not; He is like the beasts that perish."
