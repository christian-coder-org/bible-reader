    "1": "A Prayer of Moses the man of God.  Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.",
    "2": "Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.",
    "3": "Thou turnest man to contrition; And sayest: ‘Return, ye children of men.’",
    "4": "For a thousand years in Thy sight Are but as yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night.",
    "5": "Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep; In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.",
    "6": "In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.",
    "7": "For we are consumed in Thine anger, And by Thy wrath are we hurried away.",
    "8": "Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, Our secret sins in the light of Thy countenance.",
    "9": "For all our days are passed away in Thy wrath; We bring our years to an end as a tale that is told.",
    "10": "The days of our years are threescore years and ten, Or even by reason of strength fourscore years; Yet is their pride but travail and vanity; For it is speedily gone, and we fly away.",

    "16": "Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants, And Thy glory upon their children.",
    "17": "And let the graciousness of the Lord our God be upon us; Establish Thou also upon us the work of our hands; Yea, the work of our hands establish Thou it."
