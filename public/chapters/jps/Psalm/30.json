    "1": "A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House; of David.   I will extol thee, O LORD, for Thou hast raised me up, And hast not suffered mine enemies to rejoice over me.",
    "2": "O LORD my God, I cried unto Thee, and Thou didst heal me;",
    "3": "O LORD, Thou broughtest up my soul from the nether-world; Thou didst kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.",
    "4": "Sing praise unto the LORD, O ye His godly ones, And give thanks to His holy name.",
    "5": "For His anger is but for a moment, His favour is for a life-time; Weeping may tarry for the night, But joy cometh in the morning.",
    "6": "Now I had said in my security: ‘I shall never be moved.’",
    "7": "Thou hadst established, O LORD, in Thy favour my mountain as a stronghold—Thou didst hide Thy face; I was affrighted.",
    "8": "Unto Thee, O LORD, did I call, And unto the LORD I made supplication:",
    "9": "What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise Thee? Shall it declare Thy truth?",
    "10": "Hear, O LORD, and be gracious unto me; LORD, be Thou my helper.’",
    "11": "Thou didst turn for me my mourning into dancing; Thou didst loose my sackcloth, and gird me with gladness;",
    "12": "So that my glory may sing praise to Thee, and not be silent; O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto Thee for ever."
