    "1": "A Song of Ascents.  ‘Much have they afflicted me from my youth up’, Let Israel now say;",
    "2": "Much have they afflicted me from my youth up; But they have not prevailed against me.",
    "3": "The plowers plowed upon my back; They made long their furrows.",
    "4": "The LORD is righteous; He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.’",
    "5": "Let them be ashamed and turned backward, All they that hate Zion.",
    "6": "Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, Which withereth afore it springeth up;",
    "7": "Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.",
    "8": "Neither do they that go by say: ‘The blessing of the LORD be upon you; We bless you in the name of the LORD.’"
