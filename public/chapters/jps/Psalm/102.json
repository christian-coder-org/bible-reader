    "1": "A Prayer of the afflicted, when he fainteth, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD.   O LORD, hear my prayer, And let my cry come unto Thee.",
    "2": "Hide not Thy face from me in the day of my distress; Incline Thine ear unto me; In the day when I call answer me speedily.",
    "3": "For my days are consumed like smoke, And my bones are burned as a hearth.",
    "4": "My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; For I forget to eat my bread.",
    "5": "By reason of the voice of my sighing My bones cleave to my flesh.",
    "6": "I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places.",
    "7": "I watch, and am become Like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop.",
    "8": "Mine enemies taunt me all the day; They that are mad against me do curse by me.",
    "9": "For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping,",
    "10": "Because of Thine indignation and Thy wrath; For Thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.",
    "11": "My days are like a lengthening shadow; And I am withered like grass.",
    "12": "But Thou, O LORD, sittest enthroned for ever; And Thy name is unto all generations.",
    "13": "Thou wilt arise, and have compassion upon Zion; For it is time to be gracious unto her, for the appointed time is come.",
    "14": "For Thy servants take pleasure in her stones, And love her dust.",
    "15": "So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, And all the kings of the earth Thy glory;",
    "16": "When the LORD hath built up Zion, When He hath appeared in His glory;",
    "17": "When He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, And hath not despised their prayer.",
    "18": "This shall be written for the generation to come; And a people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.",
    "19": "For He hath looked down from the height of His sanctuary; From heaven did the LORD behold the earth;",
    "20": "To hear the groaning of the prisoner; To loose those that are appointed to death;",
    "21": "That men may tell of the name of the LORD in Zion, And His praise in Jerusalem;",
    "22": "When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.",
    "23": "He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.",
    "24": "I say: ‘O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days, Thou whose years endure throughout all generations.",
    "25": "Of old Thou didst lay the foundation of the earth; And the heavens are the work of Thy hands.",
    "26": "They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall pass away;",
    "27": "But Thou art the selfsame, And Thy years shall have no end.",
    "28": "The children of Thy servants shall dwell securely, And their seed shall be established before Thee.’"
