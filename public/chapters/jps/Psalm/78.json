    "1": "Maschil of Asaph.  Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.",
    "2": "I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter dark sayings concerning days of old;",
    "3": "That which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us,",
    "4": "We will not hide from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, And His strength, and His wondrous works that He hath done.",
    "5": "For He established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which He commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children;",
    "6": "That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; Who should arise and tell them to their children,",
    "7": "That they might put their confidence in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep His commandments;",
    "8": "And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation; A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.",
    "9": "The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow, That turned back in the day of battle.",
    "10": "They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in His law;",
    "11": "And they forgot His doings, And His wondrous works that He had shown them.",
    "12": "Marvellous things did He in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.",
    "13": "He cleaved the sea, and caused them to pass through; And He made the waters to stand as a heap.",
    "14": "By day also He led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire.",
    "15": "He cleaved rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep.",
    "16": "He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.",
    "17": "Yet went they on still to sin against Him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.",
    "18": "And they tried God in their heart By asking food for their craving.",
    "19": "Yea, they spoke against God; They said ‘Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?",
    "20": "Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can He give bread also? Or will He provide flesh for His people?’",
    "21": "Therefore the LORD heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;",
    "22": "Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in His salvation.",
    "23": "And He commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;",
    "24": "And He caused manna to rain upon them for food, And gave them of the corn of heaven.",
    "25": "Man did eat the bread of the mighty; He sent them provisions to the full.",
    "26": "He caused the east wind to set forth in heaven; And by His power He brought on the south wind.",
    "27": "He caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust, And winged fowl as the sand of the seas;",
    "28": "And He let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their dwellings.",
    "29": "So they did eat, and were well filled; And He gave them that which they craved.",
    "30": "They were not estranged from their craving, Their food was yet in their mouths,",
    "31": "When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the lustieth among them, And smote down the young men of Israel.",
    "32": "For all this they sinned still, And believed not in His wondrous works.",
    "33": "Therefore He ended their days as a breath, And their years in terror.",
    "34": "When He slew them, then they would inquire after Him, And turn back and seek God earnestly.",
    "35": "And they remembered that God was their Rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.",
    "36": "But they beguiled Him with their mouth, And lied unto Him with their tongue.",
    "37": "For their heart was not stedfast with Him, Neither were they faithful in His covenant.",
    "38": "But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not; Yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away, And doth not stir up all His wrath.",
    "39": "So He remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.",
    "40": "How oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness, And grieve Him in the desert!",
    "41": "And still again they tried God, And set bounds to the Holy One of Israel.",
    "42": "They remembered not His hand, Nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary.",
    "43": "How He set His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the field of Zoan;",
    "44": "And turned their rivers into blood, So that they could not drink their streams.",
    "45": "He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.",
    "46": "He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labour unto the locust.",
    "47": "He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore-trees with frost.",
    "48": "He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to fiery bolts.",
    "49": "He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A sending of messengers of evil.",
    "50": "He levelled a path for His anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence;",
    "51": "And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;",
    "52": "But He made His own people to go forth like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.",
    "53": "And He led them safely, and they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.",
    "54": "And He brought them to His holy border, To the mountain, which His right hand had gotten.",
    "55": "He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.",
    "56": "Yet they tried and provoked God, the Most High, And kept not His testimonies;",
    "57": "But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers; They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.",
    "58": "For they provoked Him with their high places, And moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.",
    "59": "God heard, and was wroth, And He greatly abhorred Israel;",
    "60": "And He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which He had made to dwell among men;",
    "61": "And delivered His strength into captivity, And His glory into the adversary’s hand.",
    "62": "He gave His people over also unto the sword; And was wroth with His inheritance.",
    "63": "Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.",
    "64": "Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation.",
    "65": "Then the Lord awaked as one asleep, Like a mighty man recovering from wine.",
    "66": "And He smote His adversaries backward; He put upon them a perpetual reproach.",
    "67": "Moreover He abhorred the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim;",
    "68": "But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which He loved.",
    "69": "And He built His sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which He hath founded for ever.",
    "70": "He chose David also His servant, And took him from the sheepfolds;",
    "71": "From following the ewes that give suck He brought him, To be shepherd over Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.",
    "72": "So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart; And lead them by the skilfulness of his hands."
