    "1": "For the Leader. A Psalm of David.   I waited patiently for the LORD; And He inclined unto me, and heard my cry.",
    "2": "He brought me up also out of the tumultuous pit, out of the miry clay; And He set my feet upon a rock, He established my goings.",
    "3": "And He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God; Many shall see, and fear, And shall trust in the LORD.",
    "4": "Happy is the man that hath made the LORD his trust, And hath not turned unto the arrogant, nor unto such as fall away treacherously.",
    "5": "Many things hast Thou done, O LORD my God, Even Thy wonderful works, and Thy thoughts toward us; There is none to be compared unto Thee! If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be told.",
    "6": "Sacrifice and meal-offering Thou hast no delight in; Mine ears hast Thou opened; Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast Thou not required.",
    "7": "Then said I: ‘Lo, I am come With the roll of a book which is prescribed for me;",
    "8": "I delight to do Thy will, O my God; Yea, Thy law is in my inmost parts.’",
    "9": "I have preached righteousness in the great congregation, Lo, I did not refrain my lips; O LORD, Thou knowest.",
    "10": "I have not hid Thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation; I have not concealed Thy mercy and Thy truth from the great congregation.",
    "11": "Thou, O LORD, wilt not withhold Thy compassions from me; Let Thy mercy and Thy truth continually preserve me.",
    "12": "For innumerable evils have compassed me about, Mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.",
    "13": "Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me.",
    "14": "Let them be ashamed and abashed together That seek after my soul to sweep it away; Let them be turned backward and brought to confusion That delight in my hurt.",
    "15": "Let them be appalled by reason of their shame That say unto me: ‘Aha, aha.’",
    "16": "Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; Let such as love Thy salvation say continually: ‘The LORD be magnified.’",
    "17": "But, as for me, that am poor and needy, The Lord will account it unto me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; O my God, tarry not."
