    "1": "A Song, a Psalm of Asaph.   O God, keep not Thou silence; Hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God.",
    "2": "For, lo, Thine enemies are in an uproar; And they that hate Thee have lifted up the head.",
    "3": "They hold crafty converse against Thy people, And take counsel against Thy treasured ones.",
    "4": "They have said: ‘Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.’",
    "5": "For they have consulted together with one consent; Against Thee do they make a covenant;",
    "6": "The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;",
    "7": "Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;",
    "8": "Assyria also is joined with them; They have been an arm to the children of Lot.  Selah ",
    "9": "Do Thou unto them as unto Midian; As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon;",

    "15": "So pursue them with Thy tempest, And affright them with Thy storm.",
    "16": "Fill their faces with shame; That they may seek Thy name, O LORD.",
    "17": "Let them be ashamed and affrighted for ever; Yea, let them be abashed and perish;",
    "18": "That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is the LORD, The Most High over all the earth."
