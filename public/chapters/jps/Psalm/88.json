    "1": "A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Leader; upon Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.   O LORD, God of my salvation, What time I cry in the night before Thee,",
    "2": "Let my prayer come before Thee, Incline Thine ear unto my cry.",
    "3": "For my soul is sated with troubles, And my life draweth nigh unto the grave.",
    "4": "I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am become as a man that hath no help;",
    "5": "Set apart among the dead, Like the slain that lie in the grave, Whom Thou rememberest no more; And they are cut off from Thy hand.",
    "6": "Thou hast laid me in the nether-most pit, In dark places, in the deeps.",
    "7": "Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, And all Thy waves Thou pressest down.  Selah ",
    "8": "Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them; I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.",
    "9": "Mine eye languisheth by reason of affliction; I have called upon Thee, O LORD, every day, I have spread forth my hands unto Thee.",
    "10": "Wilt Thou work wonders for the dead? Or shall the shades arise and give Thee thanks?  Selah ",
    "11": "Shall Thy mercy be declared in the grave? Or Thy faithfulness in destruction?",
    "12": "Shall Thy wonders be known in the dark? And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?",
    "13": "But as for me, unto Thee, O LORD, do I cry, And in the morning doth my prayer come to meet Thee.",
    "14": "LORD, why castest Thou off my soul? Why hidest Thou Thy face from me?",
    "15": "I am afflicted and at the point of death from my youth up; I have borne Thy terrors, I am distracted.",
    "16": "Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off.",
    "17": "They came round about me like water all the day; They compassed me about together.",
    "18": "Friend and companion hast Thou put far from me, And mine acquaintance into darkness."
