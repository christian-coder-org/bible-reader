    "1": "For the Leader. A Psalm of David; when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.   Be gracious unto me, O God, according to Thy mercy; According to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgressions.",
    "2": "Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin.",
    "3": "For I know my transgressions; And my sin is ever before me.",
    "4": "Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, And done that which is evil in Thy sight; That Thou mayest be justified when Thou speakest, And be in the right when Thou judgest.",
    "5": "Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin did my mother conceive me.",
    "6": "Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts; Make me, therefore, to know wisdom in mine inmost heart.",
    "7": "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.",
    "8": "Make me to hear joy and gladness; That the bones which Thou hast crushed may rejoice.",
    "9": "Hide Thy face from my sins, And blot out all mine iniquities.",
    "10": "Create me a clean heart, O God; And renew a stedfast spirit within me.",
    "11": "Cast me not away from Thy presence; And take not Thy holy spirit from me.",
    "12": "Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation; And let a willing spirit uphold me.",
    "13": "Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways; And sinners shall return unto Thee.",
    "14": "Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; So shall my tongue sing aloud of Thy righteousness.",
    "15": "O Lord, open Thou my lips; And my mouth shall declare Thy praise.",
    "16": "For Thou delightest not in sacrifice, else would I give it; Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.",
    "17": "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; A broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.",
    "18": "Do good in Thy favour unto Zion; Build Thou the walls of Jerusalem.",
    "19": "Then wilt Thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt-offering and whole offering; Then will they offer bullocks upon Thine altar."
