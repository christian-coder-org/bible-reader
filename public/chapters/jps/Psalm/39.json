    "1": "For the Leader, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.   I said: ‘I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue; I will keep a curb upon my mouth, While the wicked is before me.’",
    "2": "I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, had no comfort; And my pain was held in check.",
    "3": "My heart waxed hot within me; While I was musing, the fire kindled; Then spoke I with my tongue:",
    "4": "LORD, make me to know mine end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how short-lived I am.",
    "5": "Behold, Thou hast made my days as hand-breadths; And mine age is as nothing before Thee; Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity.  Selah ",
    "6": "Surely man walketh as a mere semblance; Surely for vanity they are in turmoil; He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.",
    "7": "And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope, it is in Thee.",
    "8": "Deliver me from all my transgressions; Make me not the reproach of the base.",
    "9": "I am dumb, I open not my mouth; Because Thou hast done it.",
    "10": "Remove Thy stroke from off me; I am consumed by the blow of Thy hand.",
    "11": "With rebukes dost Thou chasten man for iniquity, And like a moth Thou makest his beauty to consume away; Surely every man is vanity.  Selah ",
    "12": "Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; Keep not silence at my tears; For I am a stranger with Thee, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.",
    "13": "Look away from me, that I may take comfort, Before I go hence, and be no more.’"
