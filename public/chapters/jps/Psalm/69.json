    "20": "Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am sore sick; And I looked for some to show compassion, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.",
    "21": "Yea, they put poison into my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.",
    "22": "Let their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace, let it become a trap.",
