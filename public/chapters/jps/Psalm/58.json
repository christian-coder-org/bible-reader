    "1": "For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam.   Do ye indeed speak as a righteous company? Do ye judge with equity the sons of men?",
    "2": "Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; Ye weigh out in the earth the violence of your hands.",
    "3": "The wicked are estranged from the womb; The speakers of lies go astray as soon as they are born.",
    "4": "Their venom is like the venom of a serpent; They are like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ear;",
    "5": "Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, Or of the most cunning binder of spells.",
    "6": "Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth; Break out the cheek-teeth of the young lions, O LORD.",
    "7": "Let them melt away as water that runneth apace; When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.",
    "8": "Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away; Like the untimely births of a woman, that have not seen the sun.",
    "9": "Before your pots can feel the thorns, He will sweep it away with a whirlwind, the raw and the burning alike.",
    "10": "The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.",
    "11": "And men shall say: ‘Verily there is a reward for the righteous; Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.’"
