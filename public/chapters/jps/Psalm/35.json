    "1": "[A Psalm] of David.  Strive, O LORD, with them that strive with me; Fight against them that fight against me.",
    "2": "Take hold of shield and buckler, And rise up to my help.",
    "3": "Draw out also the spear, and the battle-axe, against them that pursue me; Say unto my soul: ‘I am Thy salvation.’",
    "4": "Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion that seek after my soul; Let them be turned back and be abashed that devise my hurt.",
    "5": "Let them be as chaff before the wind, The angel of the LORD thrusting them.",
    "6": "Let their way be dark and slippery, The angel of the LORD pursuing them.",
    "7": "For without cause have they hid for me the pit, even their net, Without cause have they digged for my soul.",
    "8": "Let destruction come upon him unawares; And let his net that he hath hid catch himself; With destruction let him fall therein.",
    "9": "And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD; It shall rejoice in His salvation.",
    "10": "All my bones shall say: ‘LORD, who is like unto Thee, Who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, Yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?’",
    "11": "Unrighteous witnesses rise up; They ask me of things that I know not.",
    "12": "They repay me evil for good; Bereavement is come to my soul.",
    "13": "But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth, I afflicted my soul with fasting; And my prayer, may it return into mine own bosom.",
    "14": "I went about as though it had been my friend or my brother; I bowed down mournful, as one that mourneth for his mother.",
    "15": "But when I halt they rejoice, and gather themselves together; The abjects gather themselves together against me, and those whom I know not; They tear me, and cease not;",
    "16": "With the profanest mockeries of backbiting They gnash at me with their teeth.",
    "17": "Lord, how long wilt Thou look on? Rescue my soul from their destructions, Mine only one from the lions.",
    "18": "I will give Thee thanks in the great congregation; I will praise Thee among a numerous people.",
    "19": "Let not them that are wrongfully mine enemies rejoice over me; Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.",
    "20": "For they speak not peace; But they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.",
    "21": "Yea, they open their mouth wide against me; They say: ‘Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.’",
    "22": "Thou hast seen, O LORD; keep not silence; O Lord, be not far from me.",
    "23": "Rouse Thee, and awake to my judgment, Even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.",
    "24": "Judge me, O LORD my God, according to Thy righteousness; And let them not rejoice over me.",
    "25": "Let them not say in their heart: ‘Aha, we have our desire’; Let them not say: ‘We have swallowed him up.’",
    "26": "Let them be ashamed and abashed together that rejoice at my hurt; Let them be clothed with shame and confusion that magnify themselves against me.",
    "27": "Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that delight in my righteousness; Yea, let them say continually: ‘Magnified be the LORD, Who delighteth in the peace of His servant.’",
    "28": "And my tongue shall speak of Thy righteousness, And of Thy praise all the day."
