    "1": "Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer.   With my voice I cry unto the LORD; With my voice I make supplication unto the LORD.",
    "2": "I pour out my complaint before Him, I declare before Him my trouble;",
    "3": "When my spirit fainteth within me—Thou knowest my path—In the way wherein I walk Have they hidden a snare for me.",
    "4": "Look on my right hand, and see, For there is no man that knoweth me; I have no way to flee; No man careth for my soul.",
    "5": "I have cried unto Thee, O LORD; I have said: ‘Thou art my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.’",
    "6": "Attend unto my cry; For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors; For they are too strong for me.",
    "7": "Bring my soul out of prison, That I may give thanks unto Thy name; The righteous shall crown themselves because of me; For Thou wilt deal bountifully with me."
