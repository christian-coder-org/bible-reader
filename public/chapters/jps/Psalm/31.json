    "1": "For the Leader. A Psalm of David.   In thee, O LORD, have I taken refuge; let me never be ashamed; Deliver me in Thy righteousness.",
    "2": "Incline Thine ear unto me, deliver me speedily; Be Thou to me a rock of refuge, even a fortress of defence, to save me.",
    "3": "For Thou art my rock and my fortress; Therefore for Thy name’s sake lead me and guide me.",
    "4": "Bring me forth out of the net that they have hidden for me; For Thou art my stronghold.",
    "5": "Into Thy hand I commit my spirit; Thou hast redeemed me, O LORD, Thou God of truth.",
    "6": "I hate them that regard lying vanities; But I trust in the LORD.",
    "7": "I will be glad and rejoice in Thy lovingkindness; For Thou hast seen mine affliction, Thou hast taken cognizance of the troubles of my soul,",
    "8": "And Thou hast not given me over into the hand of the enemy; Thou hast set my feet in a broad place.",
    "9": "Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I am in distress; Mine eye wasteth away with vexation, yea, my soul and my body.",
    "10": "For my life is spent in sorrow, and my years in sighing; My strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are wasted away.",
    "11": "Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach, Yea, unto my neighbours exceedingly, and a dread to mine acquaintance; They that see me without flee from me.",
    "12": "I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am like a useless vessel.",
    "13": "For I have heard the whispering of many, Terror on every side; While they took counsel together against me, They devised to take away my life.",
    "14": "But as for me, I have trusted in Thee, O LORD; I have said: ‘Thou art my God.’",
    "15": "My times are in Thy hand; Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.",
    "16": "Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant; Save me in Thy lovingkindness.",
    "17": "O LORD, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon Thee; Let the wicked be ashamed, let them be put to silence in the nether-world.",
    "18": "Let the lying lips be dumb, Which speak arrogantly against the righteous, With pride and contempt.",
    "19": "Oh how abundant is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee; Which Thou hast wrought for them that take their refuge in Thee, in the sight of the sons of men!",
    "20": "Thou hidest them in the covert of Thy presence from the plottings of man; Thou concealest them in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.",
    "21": "Blessed be the LORD; For He hath shown me His wondrous lovingkindness in an entrenched city.",
    "22": "As for me, I said in my haste: ‘I am cut off from before Thine eyes’; Nevertheless Thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto Thee.",
    "23": "O love the LORD, all ye His godly ones; The LORD preserveth the faithful, And plentifully repayeth him that acteth haughtily.",
    "24": "Be strong, and let your heart take courage, All ye that wait for the LORD."
