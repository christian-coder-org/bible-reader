    "1": "For the Leader. A Psalm of David.   Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; Preserve my life from the terror of the enemy.",
    "2": "Hide me from the council of evil-doers; From the tumult of the workers of iniquity;",
    "3": "Who have whet their tongue like a sword, And have aimed their arrow, a poisoned word;",
    "4": "That they may shoot in secret places at the blameless; Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.",
    "5": "They encourage one another in an evil matter; They converse of laying snares secretly; They ask, who would see them.",
    "6": "They search out iniquities, they have accomplished a diligent search; Even in the inward thought of every one, and the deep heart.",
    "7": "But God doth shoot at them with an arrow suddenly; Thence are their wounds.",
    "8": "So they make their own tongue a stumbling unto themselves; All that see them shake the head.",
    "9": "And all men fear; And they declare the work of God, And understand His doing.",
    "10": "The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall take refuge in Him; And all the upright in heart shall glory."
