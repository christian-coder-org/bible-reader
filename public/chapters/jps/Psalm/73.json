    "1": "A Psalm of Asaph.  Surely God is good to Israel, Even to such as are pure in heart.",
    "2": "But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well nigh slipped.",
    "3": "For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.",
    "4": "For there are no pangs at their death, And their body is sound.",
    "5": "In the trouble of man they are not; Neither are they plagued like men.",
    "6": "Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covereth them as a garment.",
    "7": "Their eyes stand forth from fatness; They are gone beyond the imaginations of their heart.",
    "8": "They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression; They speak as if there were none on high.",
    "9": "They have set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue walketh through the earth.",
    "10": "Therefore His people return hither; And waters of fullness are drained out by them.",
    "11": "And they say: ‘How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?’",
    "12": "Behold, such are the wicked; And they that are always at ease increase riches.",
    "13": "Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency;",
    "14": "For all the day have I been plagued, And my chastisement came every morning.",
    "15": "If I had said: ‘I will speak thus’, Behold, I had been faithless to the generation of Thy children.",
    "16": "And when I pondered how I might know this, It was wearisome in mine eyes;",
    "17": "Until I entered into the sanctuary of God, And considered their end.",
    "18": "Surely Thou settest them in slippery places; Thou hurlest them down to utter ruin.",
    "19": "How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are wholly consumed by terrors.",
    "20": "As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when Thou arousest Thyself, Thou wilt despise their semblance.",
    "21": "For my heart was in a ferment, And I was pricked in my reins.",
    "22": "But I was brutish, and ignorant; I was as a beast before Thee.",
    "23": "Nevertheless I am continually with Thee; Thou holdest my right hand.",
    "24": "Thou wilt guide me with Thy counsel, And afterward receive me with glory.",
    "25": "Whom have I in heaven but Thee? And beside Thee I desire none upon earth.",
    "26": "My flesh and my heart faileth; But God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever.",
    "27": "For, lo, they that go far from Thee shall perish; Thou dost destroy all them that go astray from Thee.",
    "28": "But as for me, the nearness of God is my good; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, That I may tell of all Thy works."
