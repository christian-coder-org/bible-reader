    "1": "A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.   O God, Thou art my God, earnestly will I seek Thee; My soul thirsteth for Thee, my flesh longeth for Thee, In a dry and weary land, where no water is.",
    "2": "So have I looked for Thee in the sanctuary, To see Thy power and Thy glory.",
    "3": "For Thy lovingkindness is better than life; My lips shall praise Thee.",
    "4": "So will I bless Thee as long as I live; In Thy name will I lift up my hands.",
    "5": "My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness; And my mouth doth praise Thee with joyful lips;",
    "6": "When I remember Thee upon my couch, And meditate on Thee in the night-watches.",
    "7": "For Thou hast been my help, And in the shadow of Thy wings do I rejoice.",
    "8": "My soul cleaveth unto Thee; Thy right hand holdeth me fast.",
    "9": "But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, Shall go into the nethermost parts of the earth.",
    "10": "They shall be hurled to the power of the sword; They shall be a portion for foxes.",
    "11": "But the king shall rejoice in God; Every one that sweareth by Him shall glory; For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped."
