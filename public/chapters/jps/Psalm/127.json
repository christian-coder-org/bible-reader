    "1": "A Song of Ascents; of Solomon.  Except the LORD build the house, They labour in vain that build it; Except the LORD keep the city, The watchman waketh but in vain.",
    "2": "It is vain for you that ye rise early, and sit up late, Ye that eat the bread of toil; So He giveth unto His beloved in sleep.",
    "3": "Lo, children are a heritage of the LORD; The fruit of the womb is a reward.",
    "4": "As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the children of one’s youth.",
    "5": "Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; They shall not be put to shame, When they speak with their enemies in the gate."
