    "1": "Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, or set foot on the path of sinners, or sit in the seat of mockers.",
    "2": "But his delight is in the Law of the LORD, and on His law he meditates day and night.",
    "3": "He is like a tree planted by streams of water, yielding its fruit in season, whose leaf does not wither, and who prospers in all he does.",
    "4": "Not so the wicked! For they are like chaff driven off by the wind.",
    "5": "Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.",
    "6": "For the LORD guards the path of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish."
