    "1": "A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.",
    "2": "He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.",
    "3": "He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of His name.",
    "4": "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.",
    "5": "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.",
    "6": "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever."
