    "1": "A song of ascents. When the LORD restored the captives of Zion, we were like dreamers.",
    "2": "Then our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with shouts of joy. Then it was said among the nations, “The LORD has done great things for them.”",
    "3": "The LORD has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.",
    "4": "Restore our captives, O LORD, like streams in the Negev.",
    "5": "Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.",
    "6": "He who goes out weeping, bearing a trail of seed, will surely return with shouts of joy, carrying sheaves of grain."
