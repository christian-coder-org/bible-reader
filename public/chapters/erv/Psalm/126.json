    "1": "A Song of Ascents. When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like unto them that dream.",
    "2": "Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the nations, The LORD hath done great things for them.",
    "3": "The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.",
    "4": "Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the South.",
    "5": "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.",
    "6": "Though he goeth on his way weeping, bearing forth the seed; he shall come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him."
