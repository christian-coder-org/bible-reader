    "1": "BOOK III A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart.",
    "2": "But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.",
    "3": "For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.",
    "4": "For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.",
    "5": "They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.",
    "6": "Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; violence covereth them as a garment.",
    "7": "Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.",
    "8": "They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: they speak loftily.",
    "9": "They have set their mouth in the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.",
    "10": "Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out by them.",
    "11": "And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?",
    "12": "Behold, these are the wicked; and, being alway at ease, they increase in riches.",
    "13": "Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocency;",
    "14": "For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.",
    "15": "If I had said, I will speak thus; behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.",
    "16": "When I thought how I might know this, it was too painful for me;",
    "17": "Until I went into the sanctuary of God, and considered their latter end.",
    "18": "Surely thou settest them in slippery places: thou castest them down to destruction.",
    "19": "How are they become a desolation in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.",
    "20": "As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.",
    "21": "For my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins:",
    "22": "So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee.",
    "23": "Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden my right hand.",
    "24": "Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.",
    "25": "Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.",
    "26": "My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.",
    "27": "For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.",
    "28": "But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all thy works."
