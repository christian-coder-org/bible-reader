    "1": "For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves. My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter: I speak the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.",
    "2": "Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.",
    "3": "Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, thy glory and thy majesty.",
    "4": "And in thy majesty ride on prosperously, because of truth and meekness and righteousness: and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.",
    "5": "Thine arrows are sharp; the peoples fall under thee; they are in the heart of the king’s enemies.",
    "6": "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.",
    "7": "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.",
    "8": "All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia; out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.",
    "9": "Kings’ daughters are among thy honourable women: at thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.",
    "10": "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house;",

    "14": "She shall be led unto the king in broidered work: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.",
    "15": "With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led: they shall enter into the king’s palace.",
    "16": "Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth.",
