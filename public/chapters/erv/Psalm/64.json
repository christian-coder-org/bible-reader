    "1": "For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.",
    "2": "Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers; from the tumult of the workers of iniquity:",
    "3": "Who have whet their tongue like a sword, and have aimed their arrows, even bitter words:",
    "4": "That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.",
    "5": "They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?",
    "6": "They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, say they, a diligent search: and the inward thought of every one, and the heart, is deep.",
    "7": "But God shall shoot at them; with an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded.",
    "8": "So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them: all that see them shall wag the head.",
    "9": "And all men shall fear; and they shall declare the work of God, and shall wisely consider of his doing.",
    "10": "The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory."
