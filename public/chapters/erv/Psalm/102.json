    "1": "A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.",
    "2": "Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress: incline thine ear unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily.",
    "3": "For my days consume away like smoke, and my bones are burned as a firebrand.",
    "4": "My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; for I forget to eat my bread.",
    "5": "By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my flesh.",
    "6": "I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places.",
    "7": "I watch, and am become like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop.",
    "8": "Mine enemies reproach me all the day; they that are mad against me do curse by me.",
    "9": "For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.",
    "10": "Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.",
    "11": "My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.",
    "12": "But thou, O LORD, shalt abide for ever; and thy memorial unto all generations.",
    "13": "Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for it is time to have pity upon her, yea, the set time is come.",
    "14": "For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity upon her dust.",
    "15": "So the nations shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory:",

    "17": "He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, and hath not despised their prayer.",
    "18": "This shall be written for the generation to come: and a people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.",
    "19": "For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;",
    "20": "To hear the sighing of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;",
    "21": "That men may declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;",
    "22": "When the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.",
    "23": "He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.",
    "24": "I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.",
    "25": "Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands.",
    "26": "They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:",
    "27": "But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.",
    "28": "The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee."
