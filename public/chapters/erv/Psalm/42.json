    "1": "BOOK II For the Chief Musician; Maschil of the sons of Korah. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.",
    "2": "My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?",
    "3": "My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?",
    "4": "These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I went with the throng, and led them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.",
    "5": "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the health of his countenance.",
    "6": "O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore do I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.",
    "7": "Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.",
    "8": "Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day-time, and in the night his song shall be with me, even a prayer unto the God of my life.",
    "9": "I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?",
    "10": "As with a sword in my bones, mine adversaries reproach me; while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?",
    "11": "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God."
