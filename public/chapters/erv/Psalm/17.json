    "1": "A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry; give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.",
    "2": "Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes look upon equity.",
    "3": "Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.",
    "4": "As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent.",
    "5": "My steps have held fast to thy paths, my feet have not slipped.",
    "6": "I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.",
    "7": "Shew thy marvelous lovingkindness, O thou that savest them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them, by thy right hand.",
    "8": "Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,",
    "9": "From the wicked that spoil me, my deadly enemies, that compass me about.",
    "10": "They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.",
    "11": "They have now compassed us in our steps: they set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.",
    "12": "He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.",
    "13": "Arise, O LORD, confront him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword;",
    "14": "From men, by thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: they are satisfied with children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.",
    "15": "As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness."
