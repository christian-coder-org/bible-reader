    "1": "Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD; concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me:",
    "2": "Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.",
    "3": "O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;",
    "4": "If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary:)",
    "5": "Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah",

    "15": "He hath made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.",
    "16": "His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate.",
    "17": "I will give thanks unto the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High."
