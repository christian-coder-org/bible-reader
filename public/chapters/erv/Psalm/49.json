    "1": "For the Chief Musician; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Hear this, all ye peoples; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:",
    "2": "Both low and high, rich and poor together.",
    "3": "My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.",
    "4": "I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.",
    "5": "Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when iniquity at my heels compasseth me about?",
    "6": "They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;",
    "7": "None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:",
    "8": "(For the redemption of their soul is costly, and must be let alone for ever:)",
    "9": "That he should still live alway, that he should not see corruption.",
    "10": "For he seeth that wise men die, the fool and the brutish together perish, and leave their wealth to others.",
    "11": "Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.",
    "12": "But man abideth not in honour: he is like the beasts that perish.",
    "13": "This their way is their folly: yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah",
    "14": "They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd: and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume, that there be no habitation for it.",
    "15": "But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol: for he shall receive me. Selah",
    "16": "Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased:",
    "17": "For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.",
    "18": "Though while he lived he blessed his soul, and men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself,",
    "19": "He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see the light.",
    "20": "Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish."
