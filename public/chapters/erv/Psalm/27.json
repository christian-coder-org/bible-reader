    "1": "A Psalm of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?",
    "2": "When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.",
    "3": "Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, even then will I be confident.",
    "4": "One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.",
    "5": "For in the day of trouble he shall keep me secretly in his pavilion: in the covert of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall lift me up upon a rock.",
    "6": "And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; and I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.",
    "7": "Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.",
    "8": "When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.",
    "9": "Hide not thy face from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.",
    "10": "For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the LORD will take me up.",
    "11": "Teach me thy way, O LORD; and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.",
    "12": "Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.",
    "13": "I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.",
    "14": "Wait on the LORD: be strong, and let thine heart take courage; yea, wait thou on the LORD."
