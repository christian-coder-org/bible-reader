    "4": "Blessed is the man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.",
    "5": "Many, O LORD my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be set in order unto thee; if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.",
    "6": "Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.",
