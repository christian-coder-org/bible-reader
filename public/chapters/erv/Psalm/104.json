    "1": "Bless the LORD O my soul, O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.",
    "2": "Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:",
    "3": "Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh the clouds his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind:",
    "4": "Who maketh winds his messengers; his ministers a flaming fire:",
    "5": "Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved for ever.",
    "6": "Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains.",
    "7": "At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away;",
    "8": "They went up by the mountains, they went down by the valleys, unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.",
    "9": "Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.",
    "10": "He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; they run among the mountains:",
    "11": "They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst.",
    "12": "By them the fowl of the heaven have their habitation, they sing among the branches.",
    "13": "He watereth the mountains from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.",
    "14": "He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man; that he may bring forth food out of the earth:",
    "15": "And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread that strengtheneth manâ€™s heart.",
    "16": "The trees of the LORD are satisfied; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;",
    "17": "Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.",
    "18": "The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the conies.",
    "19": "He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.",
    "20": "Thou makest darkness, and it is night; Wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.",
    "21": "The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.",
    "22": "The sun ariseth, they get them away, and lay them down in their dens.",
    "23": "Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.",
    "24": "O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.",
    "25": "Yonder is the sea, great and wide, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.",
    "26": "There go the ships; there is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to take his pastime therein.",
    "27": "These wait all upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.",
    "28": "That thou givest unto them they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are satisfied with good.",
    "29": "Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their breath they die, and return to their dust.",
    "30": "Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the ground.",
    "31": "Let the glory of the LORD endure for ever; let the LORD rejoice in his works:",
    "32": "Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.",
    "33": "I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.",
    "34": "Let my meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in the LORD.",
    "35": "Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD."
