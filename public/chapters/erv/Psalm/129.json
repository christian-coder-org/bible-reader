    "1": "A Song of Ascents. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, let Israel now say;",
    "2": "Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up: yet they have not prevailed against me.",
    "3": "The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows.",
    "4": "The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.",
    "5": "Let them be ashamed and turned backward, all they that hate Zion.",
    "6": "Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:",
    "7": "Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.",
    "8": "Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you; we bless you in the name of the LORD."
