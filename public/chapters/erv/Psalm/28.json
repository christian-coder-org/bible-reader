    "1": "A Psalm of David. Unto thee, O LORD, will I call; my rock, be not thou deaf unto me: lest, if thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.",
    "2": "Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.",
    "3": "Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity; which speak peace with their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.",
    "4": "Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings: give them after the operation of their hands; render to them their desert.",
    "5": "Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall break them down and not build them up.",
    "6": "Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.",
    "7": "The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will praise him.",
    "8": "The LORD is their strength, and he is a strong hold of salvation to his anointed.",
    "9": "Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and bear them up for ever."
