    "4": "The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, saith, He will not require it. All his thoughts are, There is no God.",
    "5": "His ways are firm at all times; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.",
    "6": "He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved: to all generations I shall not be in adversity.",
