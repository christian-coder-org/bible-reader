    "1": "A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. O LORD, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:",
    "2": "Let my prayer enter into thy presence; incline thine ear unto my cry:",
    "3": "For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto Sheol.",
    "4": "I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am as a man that hath no help:",
    "5": "Cast off among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more; and they are cut off from thy hand.",
    "6": "Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, in the deeps.",
    "7": "Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah",
    "8": "Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.",
    "9": "Mine eye wasteth away by reason of affliction: I have called daily upon thee, O LORD, I have spread forth my hands unto thee.",
    "10": "Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall they that are deceased arise and praise thee? Selah",
    "11": "Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in Destruction?",
    "12": "Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?",
    "13": "But unto thee, O LORD, have I cried, and in the morning shall my prayer come before thee.",
    "14": "LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?",
    "15": "I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.",
    "16": "Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; thy terrors have cut me off.",
    "17": "They came round about me like water all the day long; they compassed me about together.",
    "18": "Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness."
