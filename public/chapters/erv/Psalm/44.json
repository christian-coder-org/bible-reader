    "1": "For the Chief Musician; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the days of old.",
    "2": "Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand, and plantedst them in; thou didst afflict the peoples, and didst spread them abroad.",
    "3": "For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.",
    "4": "Thou art my King, O God: command deliverance for Jacob.",
    "5": "Through thee will we push down our adversaries: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.",
    "6": "For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.",
    "7": "But thou hast saved us from our adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us.",
    "8": "In God have we made our boast all the day long, and we will give thanks unto thy name for ever. Selah",
    "9": "But now thou hast cast us off, and brought us to dishonour; and goest not forth with our hosts.",
    "10": "Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.",
    "11": "Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the nations.",
    "12": "Thou sellest thy people for nought, and hast not increased thy wealth by their price.",
    "13": "Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.",
    "14": "Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.",
    "15": "All the day long is my dishonour before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,",
    "16": "For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the avenger.",
    "17": "All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.",
    "18": "Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;",
    "19": "That thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.",
    "20": "If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god;",
    "21": "Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.",
    "22": "Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.",
    "23": "Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.",
    "24": "Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?",
    "25": "For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.",
    "26": "Rise up for our help, and redeem us for thy lovingkindnessâ€™ sake."
