    "1": "A Psalm of David. LORD, I have called upon thee; make haste unto me: give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee.",
    "2": "Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee; the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.",
    "3": "Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.",
    "4": "Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to be occupied in deeds of wickedness with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.",
    "5": "Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; let not my head refuse it: for even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.",
    "6": "Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; and they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.",
    "7": "As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth, our bones are scattered at the graveâ€™s mouth.",
    "8": "For mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee do I put my trust; leave not my soul destitute.",
    "9": "Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the gins of the workers of iniquity.",
    "10": "Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape."
