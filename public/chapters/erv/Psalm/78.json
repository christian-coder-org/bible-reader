    "1": "Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.",
    "2": "I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old:",
    "3": "Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.",
    "4": "We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.",
    "5": "For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:",
    "6": "That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and tell them to their children:",
    "7": "That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:",
    "8": "And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.",
    "9": "The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.",
    "10": "They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;",
    "11": "And they forgat his doings, and his wondrous works that he had shewed them.",
    "12": "Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.",
    "13": "He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.",
    "14": "In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.",
    "15": "He clave rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.",
    "16": "He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.",
    "17": "Yet went they on still to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.",
    "18": "And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.",
    "19": "Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?",
    "20": "Behold, he smote the rock, that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; can he give bread also? will he provide flesh for his people?",
    "21": "Therefore the LORD heard, and was wroth: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel;",
    "22": "Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation.",
    "23": "Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;",
    "24": "And he rained down manna upon them to eat, and gave them of the corn of heaven.",
    "25": "Man did eat the bread of the mighty: he sent them meat to the full.",
    "26": "He caused the east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he guided the south wind.",
    "27": "He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, and winged fowl as the sand of the seas:",
    "28": "And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.",
    "29": "So they did eat, and were well filled; and he gave them that they lusted after.",
    "30": "They were not estranged from their lust, their meat was yet in their mouths,",
    "31": "When the anger of God went up against them, and slew of the fattest of them, and smote down the young men of Israel.",
    "32": "For all this they sinned still, and believed not in his wondrous works.",
    "33": "Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in terror.",
    "34": "When he slew them, then they inquired after him: and they returned and sought God early.",
    "35": "And they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.",
    "36": "But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue.",
    "37": "For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant.",
    "38": "But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.",
    "39": "And he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.",
    "40": "How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!",
    "41": "And they turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.",
    "42": "They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary.",
    "43": "How he set his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan;",
    "44": "And turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, that they could not drink.",
    "45": "He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.",
    "46": "He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.",
    "47": "He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.",
    "48": "He gave over their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.",
    "49": "He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a band of angels of evil.",
    "50": "He made a path for his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;",
    "51": "And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham:",
    "52": "But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.",
    "53": "And he led them safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.",
    "54": "And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.",
    "55": "He drove out the nations also before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.",
    "56": "Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and kept not his testimonies;",
    "57": "But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.",
    "58": "For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.",
    "59": "When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:",
    "60": "So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;",
    "61": "And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the adversaryâ€™s hand.",
    "62": "He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.",
    "63": "Fire devoured their young men; and their maidens had no marriage-song.",
    "64": "Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.",
    "65": "Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.",
    "66": "And he smote his adversaries backward: he put them to a perpetual reproach.",
    "67": "Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;",
    "68": "But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.",
    "69": "And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath established for ever.",
    "70": "He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:",
    "71": "From following the ewes that give suck he brought him, to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.",
    "72": "So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands."
