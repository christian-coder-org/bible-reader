    "1": "A Psalm of David. Blessed be the LORD my rock, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:",
    "2": "My lovingkindness, and my fortress, my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.",
    "3": "LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?",
    "4": "Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.",
    "5": "Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.",
    "6": "Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.",
    "7": "Stretch forth thine hand from above; rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hand of strangers;",
    "8": "Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.",
    "9": "I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.",
    "10": "It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword.",
    "11": "Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of strangers, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.",
    "12": "When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth; and our daughters as corner stones hewn after the fashion of a palace;",
    "13": "When our garners are full, affording all manner of store; and our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;",
    "14": "When our oxen are well laden; when there is no breaking in, and no going forth, and no outcry in our streets;",
    "15": "Happy is the people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is the people, whose God is the LORD."
