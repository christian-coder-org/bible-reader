    "1": "For the Chief Musician; set to Aijeleth hash-Shahar. A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?",

    "3": "But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.",
    "4": "Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.",
    "5": "They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not ashamed.",
    "6": "But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.",
    "7": "All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,",
    "8": "Commit thyself unto the LORD; let him deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighteth in him.",
    "9": "But thou art he that took me out the womb: thou didst make me trust when I was upon my mother’s breasts.",
    "10": "I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother’s belly.",
    "11": "Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.",
    "12": "Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.",
    "13": "They gape upon me with their mouth, as a ravening and a roaring lion.",
    "14": "I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.",
    "15": "My Strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.",
    "16": "For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of evil-doers have enclosed me; they pierced my hands and my feet.",
    "17": "I may tell all my bones; they look and stare upon me:",
    "18": "They part my garments among them, and upon my vesture do they cast lots.",
    "19": "But be not thou far off, O LORD: O thou my succour, haste thee to help me.",
    "20": "Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog;",
    "21": "Save me from the lion’s mouth; yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen thou hast answered me.",
    "22": "I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.",
    "23": "Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel.",
    "24": "For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.",
    "25": "Of thee cometh my praise in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.",
    "26": "The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek after him: let your heart live for ever.",
    "27": "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.",
    "28": "For the kingdom is the LORD’S: and he is the ruler over the nations.",
    "29": "All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him, even he that cannot keep his soul alive.",
    "30": "A seed shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation.",
    "31": "They shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it."
