    "1": "They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but stays for ever.",
    "2": "As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from now on even for ever.",
    "3": "For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands to iniquity.",

    "5": "As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be on Israel."
