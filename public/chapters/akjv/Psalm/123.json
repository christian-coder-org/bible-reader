    "1": "To you lift I up my eyes, O you that dwell in the heavens.",
    "2": "Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait on the LORD our God, until that he have mercy on us.",
    "3": "Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy on us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.",
    "4": "Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud."
