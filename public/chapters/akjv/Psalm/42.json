    "1": "As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after you, O God.",
    "2": "My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?",
    "3": "My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say to me, Where is your God?",
    "4": "When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy day.",
    "5": "Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disquieted in me? hope you in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.",
    "6": "O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember you from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.",
    "7": "Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterspouts: all your waves and your billows are gone over me.",
    "8": "Yet the LORD will command his loving kindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer to the God of my life.",

    "11": "Why are you cast down, O my soul? and why are you disquieted within me? hope you in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God."
