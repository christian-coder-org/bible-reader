    "1": "O lord, you have searched me, and known me.",
    "2": "You know my sitting down and my rising up, you understand my thought afar off.",
    "3": "You compass my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.",
    "4": "For there is not a word in my tongue, but, see, O LORD, you know it altogether.",
    "5": "You have beset me behind and before, and laid your hand on me.",
    "6": "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain to it.",
    "7": "Where shall I go from your spirit? or where shall I flee from your presence?",
    "8": "If I ascend up into heaven, you are there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there.",
    "9": "If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;",

    "15": "My substance was not hid from you, when I was made in secret, and curiously worked in the lowest parts of the earth.",
    "16": "Your eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; and in your book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.",
    "17": "How precious also are your thoughts to me, O God! how great is the sum of them!",
    "18": "If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with you.",
    "19": "Surely you will slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, you bloody men.",
    "20": "For they speak against you wickedly, and your enemies take your name in vain.",
    "21": "Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate you? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against you?",
    "22": "I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them my enemies.",
    "23": "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:",
    "24": "And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."
