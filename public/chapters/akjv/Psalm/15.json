    "1": "Lord, who shall abide in your tabernacle? who shall dwell in your holy hill?",
    "2": "He that walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart.",
    "3": "He that backbites not with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor.",
    "4": "In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honors them that fear the LORD. He that swears to his own hurt, and changes not.",
    "5": "He that puts not out his money to usury, nor takes reward against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved."
