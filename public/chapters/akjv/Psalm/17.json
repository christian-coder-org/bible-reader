    "1": "Hear the right, O LORD, attend to my cry, give ear to my prayer, that goes not out of feigned lips.",
    "2": "Let my sentence come forth from your presence; let your eyes behold the things that are equal.",
    "3": "You have proved my heart; you have visited me in the night; you have tried me, and shall find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.",
    "4": "Concerning the works of men, by the word of your lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.",
    "5": "Hold up my goings in your paths, that my footsteps slip not.",
    "6": "I have called on you, for you will hear me, O God: incline your ear to me, and hear my speech.",
    "7": "Show your marvelous loving kindness, O you that save by your right hand them which put their trust in you from those that rise up against them.",
    "8": "Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of your wings,",
    "9": "From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.",
    "10": "They are enclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.",
    "11": "They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;",
    "12": "Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.",
    "13": "Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is your sword:",
    "14": "From men which are your hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly you fill with your hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.",
    "15": "As for me, I will behold your face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with your likeness."
