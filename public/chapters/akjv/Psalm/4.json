    "2": "O you sons of men, how long will you turn my glory into shame? how long will you love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.",
    "3": "But know that the LORD has set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call to him.",

    "6": "There be many that say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift you up the light of your countenance on us.",
